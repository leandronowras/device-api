# Device API

RESTful API for device management built with Go, DuckDB for persistence, and BDD testing.

### Tech Choices
* Go:
    - Designed for simplicity and efficiency, making it easy to build scalable and performant applications, particularly suitable for microservices architecture such as RESTful APIs.â€©	
    - Features built-in support for concurrency, enabling the management of multiple devices simultaneously without blocking operations, which enhances responsiveness and performance.â€©	
    - Strongly typed with garbage collection, minimizing runtime errors, improving code reliability, and simplifying maintenance.

* **Persistence with DuckDB**: 
  - Offers efficient data storage and retrieval, optimized for analytical workloads.
  - Provides a lightweight, serverless database solution that simplifies deployment and maintenance.
  - Supports complex queries and analytics directly within the database, improving performance and reducing data transfer overhead.

* **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Testing**: 
  - Promotes collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders by using natural language scenarios.
  - Ensures that the system meets user requirements and behaves as expected through comprehensive testing.
  - Facilitates early detection of issues, reducing development costs and time by addressing problems before they escalate.

### How It Works

The codebase is organized into three layers that keep concerns separated:

- **Domain Layer** (`internal/device`) â€” Core business logic: device entities, validation rules, and factory methods. No dependencies on HTTP or database.
- **Repository Layer** (`internal/repository`) â€” Data persistence abstraction with a DuckDB implementation. Swap storage without touching business logic.
- **HTTP Layer** (`internal/http`) â€” REST API handlers that translate HTTP requests into domain operations and back to JSON responses.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/v1/devices` | Create device |
| GET | `/v1/devices` | List devices (filter: `brand`, `state`; pagination: `page`, `limit`) |
| GET | `/v1/devices/{id}` | Get device by ID |
| PATCH | `/v1/devices/{id}` | Update device |
| DELETE | `/v1/devices/{id}` | Delete device |

### Device States

- `available` (default)
- `in-use`
- `inactive`

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23+
- Docker (optional)

### Running Locally

```bash
go run cmd/app/main.go
```

API runs at `http://localhost:8080/v1/devices`

### Running with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Testing

```bash
go test ./...
```

BDD tests located in `test/bdd/`

## Configuration

Database: `./devices.db` (DuckDB)

Port: `8080`
